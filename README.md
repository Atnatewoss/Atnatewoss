  <summary><h3>👨‍🏫 Atnatewos's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  
Hey there! I’m Atnatewos Hailealem, a Computer Science student with a passion for front-end development. My journey to tech has been non-linear, but each step has shaped my growth in unique ways.

As a kid, I loved martial arts and freestyle football, which taught me resilience, discipline, and the importance of pushing my limits. These lessons became foundational to my coding journey, teaching me the value of steady progress and resilience when facing obstacles.

In university, I started strong, earning a 97 in my first math course. I also discovered a love for video editing and storytelling, which fueled my creativity and introduced me to design and visuals—skills I now channel into front-end development. Armed with my dad's old Canon camera, I filmed and edited videos at every opportunity—whether at school, in taxis, or in quiet spots on campus.

Balancing film-making, sports, and academics was challenging and led to a decline in my grades, but I reassessed my priorities and refocused on my studies which raised my GPA from 3.0 to 3.86.This taught me the importance of prioritizing, focusing, and pushing through challenges. More importantly, I realized that if I was serious about Computer Science, I’d have to go beyond the classroom and teach myself.

Studying C++, Java, and Algorithms helped me find my rhythm, but it was front-end development that truly drew me in. I started with small projects to learn front-end basics, eventually moving on to full web applications. Now, I'm focused on creating clean, effective designs that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use. Though this is just the beginning of my journey, I’m driven and excited to keep learning and taking on new challenges that will help me grow both as a developer and a problem-solver.
